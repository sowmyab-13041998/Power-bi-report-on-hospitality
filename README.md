# Power-bi-report-on-hospitality Domain


AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

### Task
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

* A Dashboard Designed to provide Revenue insights for an  Hospitality Domain.
* A few Metrics such as RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, SRN, DSRN, Realization, URN, BRN, Revenue, Cancellation, Capacity were thoroughly understood to utilize the true value of the data.
