# Power-bi-report-on-hospitality Domain

### Task
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

A Dashboard Designed to provide Revenue insights for an  Hospitality Domain.
A few Metrics such as RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, SRN, DSRN, Realization, URN, BRN, Revenue, Cancellation, Capacity were thoroughly understood to utilize the true value of the data.
A Dynamic Dashboard was designed, to capture in-depth analysis of Pricing, Revenue, occupancy trends, a drill down analysis by region, individual properties, booking channels were provided to plan strategic move and regain the market share and revenue. 
Implementing stakeholders’ thoughts into Dashboard through Domain Knowledge and Communication was Achieved.
